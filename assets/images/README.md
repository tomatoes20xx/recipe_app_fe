# Recipe Fallback Image

This directory contains the fallback image used when recipes don't have uploaded images.

## File Requirements

- **Filename**: `recipe_fallback.png`
- **Recommended size**: 512x512 pixels or larger (will be scaled as needed)
- **Format**: PNG (with transparency support)
- **Content**: A recipe-related image (e.g., cooking utensils, recipe book, food illustration)

## Adding Your Custom Image

1. Place your custom fallback image in this directory as `recipe_fallback.png`
2. The image will automatically be used in the app
3. If the image is not found, the app will fall back to showing an icon

## Example Ideas

- A stylized recipe book illustration
- Cooking utensils or kitchen tools
- A simple food/cooking icon
- Your app's logo or branding element
